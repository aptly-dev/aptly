* take snapshots of mirrors at any point in time, fixing state of repository at some moment of time
* publish snapshot as Debian repository, ready to be consumed by apt
* controlled update of one or more packages in snapshot from upstream mirror, tracking dependencies
* merge two or more snapshots into one
* filter repository by search query, pulling dependencies when required
* publish self-made packages as Debian repositories
* REST API for remote access
* mirror repositories "as-is" (without resigning with user's key) (+)
* support for yum repositories (+)

Current limitations:

* translations are not supported yet

Download
--------

To install aptly on Debian/Ubuntu, add new repository to ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::

    deb http://repo.aptly.info/ squeeze main

And import key that is used to sign the release::

    $ apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 9E3E53F19C7DE460

After that you can install aptly as any other software package::

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install aptly

Don't worry about squeeze part in repo name: aptly package should work on Debian squeeze+,
Ubuntu 10.0+. Package contains aptly binary, man page and bash completion.

If you would like to use nightly builds (unstable), please use following repository::

    deb http://repo.aptly.info/ nightly main

Binary executables (depends almost only on libc) are available for download from `Bintray <http://dl.bintray.com/smira/aptly/>`_.

If you have Go environment set up, you can build aptly from source by running (go 1.6+ required)::

    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/smira/aptly
    git clone https://github.com/smira/aptly $GOPATH/src/github.com/smira/aptly
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/smira/aptly
    make install

Binary would be installed to ```$GOPATH/bin/aptly``.
