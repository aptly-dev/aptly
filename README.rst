Documentation is available at `http://www.aptly.info/ <http://www.aptly.info/>`_. For support please use
open `issues <https://github.com/aptly-dev/aptly/issues>`_ or `discussions <https://github.com/aptly-dev/aptly/discussions>`_.

Aptly features:

* make mirrors of remote Debian/Ubuntu repositories, limiting by components/architectures
* take snapshots of mirrors at any point in time, fixing state of repository at some moment of time
* publish snapshot as Debian repository, ready to be consumed by apt
* controlled update of one or more packages in snapshot from upstream mirror, tracking dependencies
* merge two or more snapshots into one
* filter repository by search query, pulling dependencies when required
* publish self-made packages as Debian repositories
* REST API for remote access

Any contributions are welcome! Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Installation
=============

Aptly can be installed on several operating systems.

Debian / Ubuntu
----------------

Aptly is provided in the following debian packages:

* aptly (main binary)
* aptly-api (systemd service for REST API)
* aptly-dbgsym (debugging symbols)

The packages can be installed on official `Debian <https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=aptly>`_ and `Ubuntu <https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=aptly>`_ distributions.

Upstream Debian Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a newer version (not available in Debian/Ubuntu) of aptly is required, upstream debian packages (built from git tags) can be installed as follows:

Install the following APT key (as root)::

    wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/aptly.asc https://www.aptly.info/pubkey.txt

Define Release APT sources in ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/aptly.list``::

    deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/aptly.asc] http://repo.aptly.info/release DIST main

Where DIST is one of: ``buster``, ``bullseye``, ``bookworm``, ``focal``, ``jammy``, ``noble``

Install aptly packages::

    apt-get update
    apt-get install aptly
    apt-get install aptly-api  # REST API systemd service

CI Builds
~~~~~~~~~~

For testing new features or bugfixes, recent builds are available as CI builds (built from master, may be unstable!) and can be installed as follows:

Define CI APT sources in ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/aptly-ci.list``::

    deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/aptly.asc] http://repo.aptly.info/ci DIST main

Where DIST is one of: ``buster``, ``bullseye``, ``bookworm``, ``focal``, ``jammy``, ``noble``

Note: same gpg key is used as for the Upstream Debian Packages.

Other Operating Systems
------------------------

Binary executables (depends almost only on libc) are available on `GitHub Releases <https://github.com/aptly-dev/aptly/releases>`_ for:

- macOS / darwin (amd64, arm64)
