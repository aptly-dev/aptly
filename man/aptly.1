.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.P
aptly has integrated help that matches contents of this manual page, to get help, prepend \fBhelp\fR to command name:
.
.P
\fBaptly\fR \fBhelp\fR \fBmirror\fR \fBcreate\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
aptly is a tool to create partial and full mirrors of remote repositories, manage local repositories, filter them, merge, upgrade individual packages, take snapshots and publish them back as Debian repositories\.
.
.P
aptly\(cqs goal is to establish repeatability and controlled changes in a package\-centric environment\. aptly allows to fix a set of packages in a repository, so that package installation and upgrade becomes deterministic\. At the same time aptly allows to perform controlled, fine\-grained changes in repository contents to transition your package environment to new version\.
.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
aptly looks for configuration file in \fB/etc/aptly\.conf\fR and \fB~/\.aptly\.conf\fR, if no config file found, new one is created\. If \fB\-config=\fR flag is specified, aptly would use config file at specified location\. Also aptly needs root directory for database, package and published repository storage\. If not specified, directory defaults to \fB~/\.aptly\fR, it will be created if missing\.
.
.P
Configuration file is stored in JSON format (default values shown below):
