		Long: `
Command publishes current state of local repository ready to be consumed
by apt tools. Published repostiories appear under rootDir/public directory.
Valid GPG key is required for publishing.

Multiple component repository could be published by specifying several
components split by commas via -component flag and multiple local
repositories as the arguments:

    aptly publish repo -component=main,contrib repo-main repo-contrib

It is not recommended to publish local repositories directly unless the
repository is for testing purposes and changes happen frequently. For
production usage please take snapshot of repository and publish it
using publish snapshot command.

Example:

    $ aptly publish repo testing
