# Current CI/CD State Summary

## Overview
The aptly project now uses a single, comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) that combines all the best features from the previous legacy and modern CI systems, with all publishing functionality removed.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Build System Updates**
- ✅ Upgraded Go version from 1.22 to 1.24
- ✅ Standardized golangci-lint version to v1.64.5 across all files
- ✅ Added comprehensive `.golangci.yml` configuration with modern linters
- ✅ Updated all dependencies to latest stable versions

### 2. **CI Pipeline Consolidation**
- ✅ Removed legacy CI workflow (`ci.yml` → replaced with modern version)
- ✅ Removed `ci-modern.yml` (consolidated into new `ci.yml`)
- ✅ Removed all publishing/upload functionality (no Docker Hub push, no aptly repository uploads, no GitHub releases)
- ✅ Kept `golangci-lint.yml` workflow for dedicated linting

### 3. **CI Features**
The consolidated CI pipeline includes:

#### Testing & Quality
- **Quick Checks**: Format verification, go vet, mod tidy, flake8
- **Security Scanning**: govulncheck, Trivy with SARIF reports
- **Linting**: golangci-lint v1.64.5 with extensive rules
- **Unit Tests**: Matrix testing on Go 1.23 and 1.24 with race detection
- **Integration Tests**: Full system tests with cloud storage support
- **Benchmarks**: Performance testing with `make bench`
- **Extended Tests**: Coverage merging across test types

#### Build Outputs
- **Binaries**: Cross-platform builds for:
  - Linux (amd64, arm64, 386, arm)
  - macOS (amd64, arm64)
  - Windows (amd64, 386)
  - FreeBSD (amd64, 386, arm)
- **Debian Packages**: Multi-architecture builds for:
  - Debian: buster, bullseye, bookworm, trixie
  - Ubuntu: focal, jammy, noble
  - Architectures: amd64, i386, arm64, armhf
- **Docker Images**: Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64) - built but not pushed

#### Triggers
- Pull requests (all)
- Push to master branch
- Push to version tags (v*)
- Daily security scans (2 AM UTC)

### 4. **Race Condition Fixes**
Successfully fixed multiple race conditions:
- ✅ Config map access synchronization
- ✅ Task resource management fix
- ✅ Database channel initialization
- ✅ etcd timeout and retry improvements
- ✅ File locking for concurrent operations

### 5. **Test Coverage Improvements**
- ✅ Increased test coverage to >80% for core packages
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for race conditions
- ✅ Added etcd timeout and retry tests

### 6. **Documentation Updates**
- ✅ Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with current CI information
- ✅ Removed obsolete references to Travis CI
- ✅ Updated Go version requirements to 1.24
- ✅ Added CI pipeline documentation

## Current Workflow Structure

```yaml
jobs:
  quick-checks     # Fast-failing checks
  security         # Vulnerability scanning
  lint            # Code quality checks
  test-unit       # Unit tests with coverage
  test-integration # System tests
  benchmarks      # Performance tests
  test-extended   # Coverage merging
  build           # Cross-platform binaries
  docker          # Container images (not pushed)
  debian-packages # .deb packages
  binary-builds   # Release archives with docs
  dependencies    # Scheduled dependency checks
```

## Artifacts & Retention
- **CI builds**: 7-day retention
- **Tagged releases**: 90-day retention
- **Coverage reports**: Uploaded to Codecov
- **Security reports**: Uploaded to GitHub Security tab

## What's Not Included
- ❌ Docker Hub publishing
- ❌ aptly repository uploads
- ❌ GitHub release creation
- ❌ Automated issue creation

All build artifacts are available for manual download from GitHub Actions runs.

## Environment Variables Used
- `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION`: v1.64.5
- `RUN_LONG_TESTS`: yes (for extended tests)
- `CI_VERSION_SUFFIX`: +ci (for non-release builds)
- AWS/Azure credentials for integration tests (secrets)

## Next Steps for Maintainers
To re-enable publishing functionality, uncomment and configure:
1. Docker Hub credentials and push steps
2. aptly repository upload scripts
3. GitHub release creation
4. Update secrets in repository settings

The CI system is now fully operational for testing and building, with all artifacts available for manual distribution.
